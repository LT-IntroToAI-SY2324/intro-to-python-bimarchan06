# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
My inital thoughts of python programming was I was a bit confused. I am used to using Java and some of the mechanics of java are not implemented onto python like the uses of semi colons and how condensed the coding is compared to java coding on CodeHS. Also, I felt a little confused with how to approach some of the problems because I haven't coded in some time so I think that made my inital thoughts to python be more intimidated.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Similiarities I found between Java and Pyhton is the commands for the most of the functions are similar like for loops, absolute values, random etc. Although these are similar, Python tends to condense codes and make it so that it assumes what you are trying to run. This makes the code easier to read than Java. Also another difference is indentation. In both Java and Python you have to use indentation but Python is more strict on how you indent because indentations help determine what you are trying to run, This make sit so that Python is more case sentive in this area than Java is.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
Some things that I have learn are what the 'pop' function does. Pop lets you remove something that is in a specific position. I also learned how to write less code for similar operations that I am trying to do. This assignment was great for introducing some of the basic operations of python. It helped me see how java and pyhton are similar but different at the same time. I learned more about classes that python uses like float which can convert any values to decimals or fractions. I think it also helped me because even when I didn't know how to do something in the program this assignment allpwed me to reserach more about the python laguage and it has helped me learn how to expand my knowledge in what python has to offer.
